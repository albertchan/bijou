Bijou (Frontend)
================

The '/client' directory contains the frontend code for the Bijou web application skeleton.
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) with [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) along with 
[react-router-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux) were choosen as the frontend JavaScript framework. 
If you're not familiar with this particular stack, please read about why this combination is a sensible choice for
building user interfaces.
